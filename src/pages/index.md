Rwanda Faith Academy (RFA) exists to advocate for, raise awareness about, and promote the well-established community educational ministry in Kigali, Rwanda.  The Rwanda Faith Academy School provides faith-based education to elementary aged students in a community on the outskirts of Kigali.  More than 1,500 children attend the school.

The RFA school just finished construction of three new classrooms but they still need to buy desks for the additional students. Please consider donating to help us purchase these desks We are also seeking scholarships in the amount of $35 per month to provide support for children who could otherwise not afford school.
