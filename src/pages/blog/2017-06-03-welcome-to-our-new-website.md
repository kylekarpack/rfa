Thank you to Kyle Karpack for&#xA0;helping Rwanda Faith Academy set up our new website and fundraising platform. &#xA0;Rwanda Faith Academy (or RFA) is the name in the United States for the organization&#xA0;that raises funds and volunteer support for the Hope for Children School in Kigali, Rwanda, Africa. &#xA0;Donations to the Hope for Children School are accepted through a secure server at the New Horizons Foundation. &#xA0;New Horizons charges a small administrative fee for processing donations; all other funds will go directly to support the Hope for Children school or Pastor Alexis Ruhumuriza.
