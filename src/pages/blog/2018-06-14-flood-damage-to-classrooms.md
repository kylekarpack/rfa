In May 2018 a torrential rainstorm struck the Kicykiro District where the school is located and there was significant flooding and damage to the school.&#xA0; Two classrooms were damaged to the point that they cannot be used without major repairs.&#xA0; The estimated cost of these repairs is $4,600.&#xA0; Please&#xA0;pray for the school and to thoughtfully consider making a donation to RFA to help us repair these classrooms.
