World Teacher Day was joyously celebrated on October 5th at RFA. The teachers looked very smart in their white shirts or blouses, black pants or skirts and red ties. This &#x201C;uniform&#x201D; was chosen by the teachers for a dignified effect in the celebration of this special day. World Teachers Day is held every year on October 5th.

As the international day was established in 1994, Rwanda did not join in until 2004. This day commemorates the signing of the 1966 UNESCO/ILO (International Labor Organization) standard-setting recommendation concerning the status of teachers around the world. This day aims to give special recognition to teachers&#x2019; efforts to shape young people, recognizing teachers&#x2019; value in children&#x2019;s lives and their role in the development of Rwanda and the world in general.

Rwanda Faith Academy, as a private school, was given the honor of being asked to represent all private schools in the sector. As these private schools gathered to celebrate this special day for teachers, our Head Master shared during his presentation how quality education should be improved through helping ***all*** Rwandans, especially focusing on vulnerable children from disadvantaged families. &#x201C;The qualified Teacher is the basic pillar of a quality education&#x201D; he added.&#xA0; All of the teachers from RFA participated in a variety of presentations to uplift and motivate their colleagues in attendance.

The Sector leader from the Office of Education told the educators gathered, &#x201C;I especially appreciate Rwanda Faith Academy for their great contribution to the development of quality education in Rwanda. So I encourage them to keep up the developing.&#x201D;

Everyone in attendance received new motivation that will help lift the quality and effect the changes to education in Rwanda. The Teachers and Staff invite you, BelPres, to join them for next year&#x2019;s World Teachers Day!
