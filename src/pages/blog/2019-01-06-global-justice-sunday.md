On January 6, 2019 the Rwanda Faith Academy participated in BelPres Church&#x2019;s&#xA0; Global Justice Sunday outreach event.&#xA0; The event was the kickoff to Global Justice Month at BelPres and highlighted various justice related ministries across the world including RFA.&#xA0; RFA&#x2019;s focus at this event was to increase the number of scholarships we have allowing more students to attend the RFA school in Kigali.&#xA0; We provided each donor with a prayer card, a RFA bookmark, and a refrigerator magnet.![](/img/Global-Justice-Sunday-handouts.jpg)
