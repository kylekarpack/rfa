In November 2016 Larry Karpack and his daughter Marissa were excited to be able to travel to Rwanda and visit the Hope for Children school. &#xA0;The administrative team at the school&#xA0;showed the Karpack&#x2019;s the facility and detailed their hopes for adding additional classrooms and improving sanitation and other aspects of the facility. &#xA0;The highlight of the visit was the warm welcome provided by more than 300 students, who came to welcome the Karpack&#x2019;s even though school was out of session. &#xA0;It was amazing to see the energy and enthusiasm of the students and the dedication of the faculty and staff.
